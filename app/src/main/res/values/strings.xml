        <item>"Clothing is transformative."

              When you put something really beautiful on,you feel something.It indicates the kind of person one is on the inside.
              The language of clothing is high symbolism.CSE United is known for its elegance,magnificence and decency.We expect
              each and everyone present at this event to be dressed befitting the honour of this event.Ethnic and formal dress codes
              are the most suitable dress codes.</item>
        <item>"The art of communication is the language of leadership"

               Language is what connects people around us.It is natural to treat people with respect and we abide by this rule.
               A warm smile is the universal language of kindness.The development of language is part of the development of the
               personality,for words are the natural means of expressing thoughts and establishing understanding between people.
               We believe in decent speaking culture throughout the event.</item>
        <item>"Actions speak louder than words"

               Proper etiquette,polite and mature behaviour is expected from everyone present at the event.Let us all make an effort
               to conduct this gala event peacefully and efficiently.
