        "In the 5th year, CSE UNITED soared to an entirely new height. The event took place at the EZCC (Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre) Hall. For the first time, in five years, the event took place outside the college premises. Following our traditions, the hall was decorated, keeping in mind the significance of the celebration of the 5th year. Starting from the inauguration to the end, all the events had a cultural as well as a western touch to it. In addition, the Mr. and Miss CSE event was introduced this year."

        "CSE United is our way of welcoming the first years to our family. What better than combine it with an alumni meet as, after all, in the words of our beloved CKB Sir, an institution is not known by its faculty but its alumni."

    <string name="description_cse_2013">
        "This was the first alumni meet organised by the CSE Department of Techno India. The meet proved to be a success, and we had quite a few alumni members joining us to guide and inspire the first years. A Q-n-A session on various aspects of corporate life and academics was followed by fun events organised by the alumni members themselves. Students of the department also presented their take on the alumni website and the group led by Soumajit Biswas was declared the winner. The event came to an end with a light-hearted game of tug-of-war, with students of the first, second, third and fourth years as well as one consisting of members of the Alumni competing for the title."
